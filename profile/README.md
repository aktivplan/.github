## About

The aktivplan application is designed to facilitate collaboration between healthcare professionals and patients in the context of planning and documenting physical activities that support general heart health and well-being. It is available both as a web-based and a mobile application. aktivplan serves as a digital support and communication tool, helping health professionals and their patients jointly organize, record, and review a personalized physical activity plan.
 
Within this process, patients are guided by qualified health professionals in defining enjoyable and meaningful physical activities and related goals. The App enables patients to conveniently access their activity plan via a digital calendar, log completed activities, adjust their schedules, and access a collection of educational materials such as exercise videos. Patients and professionals can review these activity logs together during regular follow-up discussions to reflect on progress and plan next steps.
 
For health professionals, the application provides a convenient interface to view and export patients’ self-reported activity information. Exported summaries can be printed or attached to existing medical records, used as documentation for insurance or reporting purposes, and serve as a basis for discussion during follow-up consultations.
